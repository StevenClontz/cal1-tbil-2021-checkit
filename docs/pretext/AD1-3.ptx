Suppose the position of an object in kilometers
is modeled by the following function:
<me>s(t)=t^{3} + 4 \, t^{2} - 4 \, t - 3.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
Explain and demonstrate how to find the object's position,
<!--             displacement, -->
velocity, 
<!--             speed,  -->
            and acceleration at <m>1</m>
seconds. Use appropriate units for each.

A gizmo is sold for <m>\$72</m> per item. Suppose that the number of items produced is equal to the number of items sold and that
the cost (in dollars) of producing <m>x</m> gizmos is given by the
following function:
<me>C(x)=6 \, x^{3} + 9 \, x^{2} + 8 \, x + 5.</me>
