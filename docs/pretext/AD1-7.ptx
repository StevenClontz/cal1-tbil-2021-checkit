Suppose the position of an object in meters
is modeled by the following function:
<me>s(t)=-3 \, t^{3} - 2 \, t^{2} + 6 \, t - 6.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
Explain and demonstrate how to find the object's position,
<!--             displacement, -->
velocity, 
<!--             speed,  -->
            and acceleration at <m>2</m>
seconds. Use appropriate units for each.

A widget is sold for <m>\$96</m> per item. Suppose that the number of items produced is equal to the number of items sold and that
the cost (in dollars) of producing <m>x</m> widgets is given by the
following function:
<me>C(x)=5 \, x^{3} + 9 \, x^{2} + x + 4.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
 
Explain and demonstrate how to find the marginal revenue, the marginal cost, and the marginal profit
in this situation.
