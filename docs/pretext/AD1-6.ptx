                Let <m>g(x) = -x^{3} - x + 6</m>. Explain and demonstrate how to find an equation for the line tangent to the graph of <m>g(x)</m> at the point <m>(-3, 36)</m>.

Suppose the position of an object in yards
is modeled by the following function:
<me>s(t)=3 \, t^{3} - 4 \, t^{2} - 7 \, t + 3.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
Explain and demonstrate how to find the object's position,
<!--             displacement, -->
velocity, 
<!--             speed,  -->
            and acceleration at <m>3</m>
seconds. Use appropriate units for each.

A gizmo is sold for <m>\$95</m> per item. Suppose that the number of items produced is equal to the number of items sold and that
the cost (in dollars) of producing <m>x</m> gizmos is given by the
following function:
<me>C(x)=9 \, x^{3} + 9 \, x^{2} + 3 \, x + 7.</me>
                </p>

Explain and demonstrate how to find the marginal revenue, the marginal cost, and the marginal profit
in this situation.
