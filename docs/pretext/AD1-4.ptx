Suppose the position of an object in miles
is modeled by the following function:
<me>s(t)=3 \, t^{3} - 3 \, t^{2} - 7 \, t + 7.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
Explain and demonstrate how to find the object's position,
<!--             displacement, -->
velocity, 
<!--             speed,  -->
            and acceleration at <m>3</m>
seconds. Use appropriate units for each.

A widget is sold for <m>\$38</m> per item. Suppose that the number of items produced is equal to the number of items sold and that
the cost (in dollars) of producing <m>x</m> widgets is given by the
following function:
<me>C(x)=5 \, x^{3} + 8 \, x^{2} + 6 \, x + 3.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
 
Explain and demonstrate how to find the marginal revenue, the marginal cost, and the marginal profit
in this situation.
