A gizmo is sold for <m>\$837</m> per item.
The cost (in dollars) of manufacturing <m>x</m> items is given by the
following function:
<me>C(x)=7 \, x^{3} + 6 \, x^{2} + x + 4</me>

                <p>
Suppose that the number of items produced is equal to the number of items sold. 
Explain how to find the marginal revenue, the marginal cost, and the marginal profit
for this situation.
