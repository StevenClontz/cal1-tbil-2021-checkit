Each day at work, you're able to sell <m>{{base_sales}}</m> {{widget}}s
priced at <m>\${{base_cost}}</m> each. Your {{person}} is considering
adjusting this price to increase revenue ({{widget}}s sold times price).
According to your customers, it seems that you'll be able to make
<m>{{change_in_sales}}</m> more daily sales by reducing the price by
<m>\$1</m>, and you'll lose that many sales by increasing the price by
the same amount. Describe how and why your {{person}} should change the
price of a {{widget}}.

Your {{person}} tells you at work one day that they believe the price of 
the {{widget}}s you sell
should be reduced - while you currently sell <m>{{base_sales}}</m> units
weekly when priced at <m>\${{base_cost}}</m> apiece, a consultant has
determined that you'll sell <m>{{change_in_sales}}</m> more units for each
dollar you take off that price (but you'll lose as many sales if you increase
the cost by a dollar as well). Explain whether or not your {{person}} is
correct by determining the optimal change in price for a {{widget}} to
maximize revenue (units sold times price).

A {{person}} plans to grow a garden within a rectangular plot
of land. One side of this rectangle will be against a long exterior wall,
and the other three sides must be surrounded with 
<m>{{fencing}}</m> {{units}}
of fencing. Explain how to compute the maximum area of such a garden.

A {{person}} wishes to corral several animals using <m>{{fencing}}</m> {{units}}
of fencing. The corral must be rectangular, but one edge of this corral 
can utilize the long side of an existing barn rather than the fencing.
Explain how to compute the maximum area of such a corral.

You've been asked by a {{person}} to help them design a rectangular
garden containing <m>{{area}}</m> {{units}}<m>^2</m> of land. They have
a long stream that will be used for one side, but this {{person}} needs
to purchase additional fencing for the other three sides. Explain how
to determine the minimum amount of fencing this {{person}} must purchase.

You've been asked by a {{person}} to help them 
to open a petting zoo in a field behind their house,
and they will need <m>{{area}}</m> {{units}}<m>^2</m>
of rectangular space to corral your various animals.
The land they will be using is adjacent to a natural barrier that can be used
as one side of the rectangle, but they'll need to purchase additional fencing
for the other three sides. Explain how to find the minimum amount of
fencing this {{person}} will need for this corral.
